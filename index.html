            <p style="text-align:justify">My name is Fernando or Fer for short. I live in Austin, TX, but I am originally from Mexico! I enjoy coffee (a little too much), music, and sports! My favorite food are tacos (who would have guessed), specially the greasy street ones.
                I love quiet spaces where I read books and focus on myself, but I equally love a really loud Metallica concert with a lot of head banging, so I think I'm an all-around type of person.

            <p style="text-align:justify">I enrolled in the UT Coding Bootcamp to start a career in as a programmer and little by little am starting to learn different skills to make that vision become a reality. This page that you are now reading
                is my first official page completely coded by me :)
